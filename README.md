#### Some important extra notices:
- Sway does note have a default autotilling option, right now I'm using [this one](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/autotiling) 
- There's a script chaging the wallpaper every 30 mins on sway/startup, hyprlock wallpaper changes accordingly.
- Powermenu (check image 3) is written using rofi and a shell script.
